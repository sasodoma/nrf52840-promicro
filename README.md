# nRF52840 ProMicro

The nRF52840 ProMicro board is also known as the SuperMini board. It's a clone of the nice!nano board with a mix of v1 and v2 design features. The schematic is available online, albeit with a small mistake, but I was unable to find board design files. The aim of this repository is to reverse engineer the board design and determine which component is which so that I can desolder them from the board and reuse them on my custom PCB.
